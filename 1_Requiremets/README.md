## Introduction

Student management system as the name indicates will be used for managing students records will be used for various purposes. Accepting correct data will results in generating the desired output in correct format without any delay. • So this system has been enabled with validation data checkup while entering the data and before saving it to the particular file. Students will also able to check their data and modify their basic information as per their requirements.

The mini-project “Student Record Managment System Project in C” is a console application using the C programming language. This project compiled in Code Blocks with the GCC compiler. In this console application, you can do basic Student Record tasks like adding the student info, view the added student, search the students, ..etc.

This application based on file handling in C, where I have used a file-related function like fopen, fread, fwrite, ..etc.

using multiple record managment increase the readability, I have broken the application in different functions. Each function of the project extensively use in the file handing function, so it is also a great project to understand file handling in C.

Allow the operations such as:

      1 : Add Record.
      2 : View Record.
      3 : Search Record.
      4 : Modify Record.
      5 : Delete.
      6 : Exit.

## Defining our System

This is demo Database Management System. On execution the system requires from the use the login credential comprising of a unique Id and Password. On providing the correct Id and Password the operations to the database are then displayed and allowed by the program else it quits in receiving wrong information.

The menu displays options to add, delete, modify, search and display.

Add - Allows addition of new entry into the database with a unique id. View Record - Allow the view the records from database Delete - Allows deletion of a particular entry by a given id. Modify - Allows modification of a particular field of the entry by id. Search - For searching if an entry is present or not. Exit - Exit from the main menu bar.
